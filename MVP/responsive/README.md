# Factory Dashboard (Demo)

This is a small Vite + React + Tailwind demo containing the `FactoryDashboard` component. It uses mocked data and fake notification flows so you can integrate real APIs later.

Quick start (Windows, bash):

```bash
cd "d:/Final BA2/MVP"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view.

Next steps:

- Replace mock data in `src/components/FactoryDashboard.jsx` with API calls (use useEffect and fetch/axios).
- Add environment variables for API endpoints and authentication.
