0.021 (0.533)
There is a time series for each defect located in 1 of 3 parts of the bearing: ball, inner race, outer race.

Telemetry measurements are come from 3 acceleroments installed on 3 positions in the system:

Drive end (DE)
Fan end (FE)
Base (BA)
This dataset corresponds to the following conditions:

1 HP load applied to the motor
Shaft rotating speed of 1772 rpm
48 kHz sampling frequency of the accelerometers
Features
The following 9 features are calculated in other to run the fault identification prediction: maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation, RMS, skewness, kurtosis, crest factor and form factor.
Each feature is computed for time segments of 2048 points (0.04 seconds at the 48kHz accelerometer sampling frequency).

The experiments were initiated in order to characterize the performance of IQ PreAlert, a motor bearing condition assessment system developed at Rockwell. From that point on, the experimental program has expanded to provide a motor performance database which can be used to validate and/or improve a host of motor condition assessment techniques.

Inspiration
This dataset serves to the purpose of applying Machine Learning to Predictive Maintenance of industrial machinery. Iis scope is the data-driven fault diagnosis. A common task in this field is the fault detection and classification.

#2. CWRU Bearing Dataset 

About Dataset
The CWRU dataset is a widely used benchmark for bearing fault classification algorithms. It contains vibration signal data of normal and faulty bearings.

The dataset includes vibration signals of four classes of bearings measured in the experiment:

Normal bearing without fault (N)
Bearing with single point fault at the inner raceway (IR)
Bearing with single point fault at the outer raceway (OR)
Bearing with single point fault at the ball (B)

The faults of different diameters (0.007 ~ 0.028 Inches) are artificially manufactured to the bearings. In the experiment, vibration signal data was recorded using accelerometers at the drive end (DE) and fan end (FE), and the data is stored as Matlab files. The sampling rate is 12 kHz, and each Matlab file contains between ~120k to ~240k sample points.

The CWRU dataset is primarily used for multiclass classification of vibration signals of faulty bearings. It’s often used in the development and testing of machine learning models, particularly those involving signal processing and fault detection. For instance, 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to fault classification based on signal data from this dataset.

Thus, the CWRU dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working on bearing fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance applications. It provides a standardized set of data that can be used to develop, test, and compare different fault detection and classification algorithms

#6. Centrifugal Pump measurement data

About Dataset
Measurements depicting the healthy and maintenance-prone stages of two centrifugal pumps were collected in the Alexander Campus of the International Hellenic University under the supervision of Associated Professor Dimitrios Bechtsis. The dataset consists of 5,118 records and includes both running and standstill values.

Embedded sensors of the Mitsubishi Electric FA Smart condition monitoring kit collected 5,118 rows of measurements depicting key features, namely velocity_ISO, rms_demodulation, rms_acceleration, peak-to-peak acceleration and temperatures from two centrifugal pumps of the same manufacturer, in a healthy (Machine ID 1) and maintenance-prone (Machine ID 2) state respectively.

Experimented pumps work approximately every 5 minutes for a period of 1 minute filling a water tank, or in extreme cases when a large amount of water supply is requested. Following the extraction of NaN values after initial pre-processing, each pump individually outputted a sample of 2,557 rows for further analysis.

This dataset can provide a training ground for data cleaning and data analysis procedures as well as predicting the health state of centrifugal pumps using ML and DL classification algorithms and key sensor measurements as input features.
